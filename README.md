# Sorting-Analysis
Sorting Algorithms Analysis is a Java-based project designed to evaluate the performance and behavior of various sorting algorithms, implementing a unified framework for comparison. This project provides a detailed analysis of key algorithmic properties, including stability, in-place sorting, time complexity, and operation count (comparisons and swaps). It also features a built-in performance timer that measures the execution time of each algorithm in nanoseconds, allowing users to benchmark each sorting method on different datasets.
